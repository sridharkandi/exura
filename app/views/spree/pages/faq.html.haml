<h3>How safe are Adventure activities?</h3>
<p align="justify">One of the meanings of the word Adventure is ‘To take a risk; dare’ so, every adventure activity (Water, Land or Air) may involve some kind of exciting or unusual experiences. We intend to mitigate these challenges by providing you as much as information so, that you gear up for the safe but thrilling experiences. Hence, we involve well informed trekkers about the place as guides, they are well equipped as well as for certain sports they are certified.
<p>It is also the duty of the persons involved in the sports to listen to the instruction or guidelines prescribed by the trainer/guide before participation into any activity.</p></br></br>
